The quickest way to start using VPE is to import the :attr:`vim` object:

.. code:: python

    from vpe import vim

The :attr:`vim` object is an instance of the `vpe.Vim` class and is intended to
be a drop in replacement for Vim's standard :vim:`python-vim` module, but with
a number of enhancements.

- Most of Vim's functions appear as members, for example:

  .. code:: python

      vim.cursor(4, 10)            # Position cursor at row 4, column 10.
      m = vim.execute('messages')  # Get all the recent Vim messages.

- The attributes buffers, current, options, tabpages, vars, vvars and windows
  provide enhanced access to the corresponding Vim objects. For example
  vim.current.buffer provides a `Buffer` instance in place of Vim's standard
  :vim:`python-buffer`.

- The Vim registers are available using the `registers<Vim.registers>`
  attribute.

- When errors occur a `VimError` is raised, which provides a better breakdown
  of the error. This is a subclass of vim.error (:vim:`python-error`) so
  existing code that catches vim.error still works.
