The VPE directory tree is structured as a package with a single plugin.
Assuming your Vim files are in the “~/.vim” directory, add a “pack” sub-
directory and install VPE into the “~/.vim/pack” directory.

    $ cd ~/.vim/pack
    $ unzip vim-vpe.zip

The package includes a “vim-vpe/start/vpe/plugin/vpe.vim” startup script that
updates the Python path so that the vpe package can be imported.

The source code is at https://github.com/paul-ollis/vim-vpe.git. You can clone
this into ~/.vim/pack, but that will, currently, not include the Vim help file.
