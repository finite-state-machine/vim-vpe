The VPE directory tree is structured as a package with a single plugin.
Assuming your Vim files are in the “~/.vim” directory, add a “pack” sub-
directory and install VPE into the “~/.vim/pack” directory.

    $ cd ~/.vim/pack
    $ unzip vim-vpe.zip

This will create a vim-vpe directory. The most significant sub-directories
within vim-vpe are:

vpe
    The vpe package itself.

docs/html
    The VPE documentation in HTML format. I find this easier to read, but less
    convenient than the help.

start/vpe/doc
    Contains the VPE help file plus pre-generated tags.

start/vpe/examples
    Some examples, intended as an aid to learning what you can do with VPE.

start/vpe/plugin
    Containes the vpe.vim start up script, which initialises support for
    importing and using the vpe package.

The source code is at https://github.com/paul-ollis/vim-vpe.git. You can clone
this into ~/.vim/pack, but that will, currently, not include the Vim help file.
